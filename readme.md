Python Data Wrangling
=======

What is it?
-----------
Just some small question sets for you to familiarize yourself with some of the handy tools available in `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib`.

Keys will be uploaded every Friday of the week when the questions are uploaded.

Fork the repo and try to solve the puzzles, each `Jupyter Notebook` here contains the puzzles, the intended results, and the codez need some help from you.

The theme will be around GIS/Climate related topics that we might encountered in real world. But do contribute with interesting puzzles and topics you might want to share with us (ideally with a pull request).

Have fun!
